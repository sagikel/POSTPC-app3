As a client, at the first time you got a token. You have 2 options:
a. save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP)
b. use this token only in this current app-launch, and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again.

Write at least 1 pro and 1 con for each implementation (a) & (b):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**a**
pro:
- Less use of internet (no need to getting token from server).
- Less burden on server.
- Fast launch because getting local token is faster then getting from the server.

con:
- Not safe to keep the token locally - security issue.
- Server can't update his tokens if he wants.

**b**
pro:
- More secure - the hacker will need to hack the server for tokens.
- server can update himself with more secure tokens if he want or if he need.

con:
- every time we will need to do step 1 - take more time then start with step 2.
- more computation on server every launch.
- More use of internet.
